Presentation site of a village, city.
In this project i did not want to lose time on details with decisioning the collor or what image to find, or maybe what text to use
I try to learn as more as possible css, html and javascript, to understand how to use and display elements of html
Understand why sometimes it did not work, try to take all logical and come with a solution and learn from that mistake
What i learn from this site is that all things that are great have simple things at their base, try to know without
google it how to center a div with flex or margin, to know why it work, how to display elements on a line with flex or inline position
and understasnd the difference between some attributes in css, how to validate a form in js, and more important thing in my opinion 
knwowing how to search for a solution and understand the actual result and searching for a target result.
